# MemoryApp 
---
##### My first ever Java project with Graphical User Interface
Technologies used: Java, JavaFX and some CSS.
Design Pattern: MVC
***
### Key functionality
- User can set up board size
- Results of the game are stored in an external file
    - Sane way to serialize ObservableList
- User input validation & alerts
- Window with board scaled depending on user input
- Simple graphics representing cards
- Sorting results by score
- Switching between windows in JavaFX
- NO SCENE-BUILDER! :)


#### Things to improve in the future
- Enabling time counting in separate thread
- Complicate score algorithm
- Clean-up folder structure
- Exiting game with keyboard shortucts
- Communication between controllers
